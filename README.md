IDEA:
You and I, we all struggle in one thing: Sometimes, it's incredibly hard to find a new song, which can help you in your hardest time, with all the tunes you love. This project does just that, it composes new music that is unique to you and for you, when you needed it the most.

EXECUTION STEPS:
This project is devided in 3 separate parts:
1. **Emotional Dectection:** *(algorithm is open for discussion)*
	- Through facial recognition
	- Through heart pulse's patterns recognition
	- Integration of the above methods for accurate emotional reading
2. **Music Generation:** *(algorithm is open for discussion)*
	a. Collect data from user's most favorite song (from metrics such as rating or frequency)
	b. Recognize musical cords that user most likely love
	c. Compose a 2-minute-song that includes those cords
3. **Song Mashup Generation:** *(algorithm is open for discussion)*
	a. Sample user's favorite songs into an array of data
	b. Detect note pattern inside songs (most frequently used note pattern)
	c. Dectect sentences' block in songs by looking at rests
